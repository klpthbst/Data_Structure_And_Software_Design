In `HtmlValidator.java`, implement the `isValidHtml` method. `isValidHtml` should take as input a `Queue` of `HtmlTags` and return a `Stack` of `HtmlTags` that verifies the correctness of the tag structure, according to the specification described below.

The method should be implemented as follows:

If the `HTML` file is well formatted, the method should return an empty `Stack`. For example:

`<html><body><h1>heading</h1><p>paragraph</p></body></html>`

In this case, the closing tags match the opening tags, so the `HTML` is valid. When you get to the end of the `file/Queue`, the `Stack` is empty.

If the `HTML` file is not well formatted, the method should return the `Stack` in its current state (i.e., with its current values) at the time the code determined that the tags were not balanced.

Here are some example cases to consider:

`Example #1`: Tags closed in incorrect order

`<html><body><p><b>` Sentence here `</p></b></body></html>`

In this case, you would push all opening tags onto the `Stack` so that it looks like this:

`<b>`

`<p>`

`<body>`

and, upon encountering a closing tag in the `Queue`, you would want to check that `Stack` to see if the correct match is present. The first closing tag you encounter is `</p>`; however, the last opening tag (at the top of the `Stack`) is . That’s bad. As soon as you determine that the `HTML`file is not valid, return the `Stack` of opening tags without popping off the mismatched opening tag. In this case, the expected output would be a `Stack` containing (going from bottom to top): `<html><body><p><b>`

`Example #2`: Closing tag with no opening tag
`<html><body>` Correct `<br/><b>Sentence</b> here</div></body></html>`

In this case, the first closing tag that you encounter `(</b> New Roman',serif; color: #222222; background: white;">)`does match its opening tag, but the next one `(</div>)` does not, so the expected output would be a `Stack` containing (going from bottom to top):
<html><body>

Note that the `<br/>` tag is self-closing and should not be placed on the `Stack`!

`Example #3`: Opening tag never closed

`<html><body><b>` This is some text

In this case, the method reaches the end of the `file/Queue` and there are still items on the `Stack`, since those opening tags were never closed. The expected output would be a `Stack` containing (going from bottom to top):

`<html><body><b>`

`Example #4 (the tricky part!)`: Closing tag with no opening tag, everything okay until then

`<html><body><p>` Hello, world! `</p></body></html></p>`
This is similar to `Example #2` except that now when you encounter the closing tag that has no opening tag, the Stack is empty since everything before then is matched. However, returning an empty Stack means that the file is well formatted! In this case, though, you need to return null to indicate that the file is not well formatted. Think about how you can tell the difference between when to return null and when to return an empty `Stack`.

Please do not change the signature of the `isValid` method (its parameter list, name, and return value type). Also, do not create any additional `.java` files for your solution, and please do not modify `HtmlTag.java`. If you need additional classes, you can define them in `HtmlValidator.java`. Last, be sure that your `HtmlValidator` class is in the default package, i.e. there is no `“package”` declaration at the top of the source code.
